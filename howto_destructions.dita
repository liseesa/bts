  <p><b>Shading (a complete destruction of a hieroglyph)</b></p>
  <p>A complete destruction of the hieroglyphs (when the sign cannot be recognized anymore) is not
            to be reconstructed in square brackets (as in the transliteration). Instead, shading is
            applied to indicate that the destroyed sign cannot be read. The size of the destruction
            is not important as the shading will always be the same size (see screen-shot below).
            You can enter it by using "//".</p>

  <p><b>Partial Destruction</b></p>
  <p>When a sign is only partially destroyed (part of it still visible and identifiable), it is
      rendered by half-square brackets. The half-square brackets are entered with [?-Hieroglyph-?]
      (see screenshot below). Enter each partially destroyed sign separately (i.e. only one sign is
      allowed in each set of brackets).</p>

  <p><b>Missing Hieroglyphs</b></p>
  <p>If a sign or a word is missing due to an omission by the scribe in antiquity, it should not be
      added to the hieroglyphic transcription. Only what is present in the text is to be encoded. If
      there is an empty space between two signs left in antiquity, encode it with '..', as in the
      example below:</p>
