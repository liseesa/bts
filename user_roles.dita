  <title>Description of User rights</title>
  <body>
    <p>Access rights, which different users have to database objects, are conditioned by the
      following criteria: </p>
    <ul id="ul_qvj_vd2_jx">
      <li>
        <p><i>user role</i> with respect to particular corpora</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_vhp_vd2_jx">
        <li><i>user status</i> with respect to particular database objects</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_qtw_vd2_jx">
        <li><i>visibility type</i> of particular database objects</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p>Regardless of their role or status, every BTS user can: </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_lzg_jpm_ft">
        <li>Access all entries in the drop-down menu "Window".</li>
        <li>Access "Preferences/Database Manager".</li>
        <li>Adjust individual settings in "Preferences/Preferences".</li>
        <li>Access all options in the drop-down menu "Help".</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p><b>User roles</b></p>
    <p>Users can have one of five different user roles, which apply only to particular corpora:
        <xref href="UserRoles_Admin.dita#topic_ih3_blv_bt">Administrator</xref>, <xref
        href="UserRoles_Editor.dita#topic_mvz_rmv_bt">Editor</xref>, <xref
        href="UserRoles_Researcher.dita#topic_atn_xnv_bt">Researcher</xref>, <xref
        href="UserRoles_Transcriber.dita#topic_k1v_znv_bt">Transcriber</xref>, or <xref
        href="UserRoles_Guest.dita#topic_bvq_b4v_bt">Guest</xref>. One user can have different user
      roles in different corpora (but just one user role per corpus). E.g. a user can be an <xref
        href="UserRoles_Editor.dita#topic_mvz_rmv_bt">Editor</xref> in the corpus "bbawamarna", but
      a <xref href="UserRoles_Transcriber.dita#topic_k1v_znv_bt">Transcriber</xref> in the corpus
      "bbawbriefe". </p>
    <p>NOTE: Unless specifically set by a BTS administrator, the default user role is <xref
        href="UserRoles_Guest.dita#topic_bvq_b4v_bt">Guest</xref>.</p>
    <p><b>User status</b></p>
    <p>The status of <i>Reader</i> or <i>Updater</i> can be assigned to a user with respect to
      specific database objects. E.g. a researcher with the status of Updater can edit all items in
      a given corpus. If his/her status is changed to Reader, the user will only be able to view the
      items. The Updater and Reader status with regard to specific database objects in a corpus can
      be assigned to a user by an <xref href="UserRoles_Admin.dita#topic_ih3_blv_bt">Admin</xref>,
        <xref href="UserRoles_Editor.dita#topic_mvz_rmv_bt">Editor</xref>, or <xref
        href="UserRoles_Researcher.dita#topic_atn_xnv_bt">Researcher</xref> (the latter needs to
      have the Updater status) of a given corpus. This is done by right-clicking on a database
      object, selecting "Edit Updaters/Readers", and assigning a user to a user status through the
      menu on the right.</p>
    <p>NOTE: Obtaining the Reader/Updater status for an entire corpus does not extend to individual
      items within that corpus; such a status has to be assigned for every database object which the
      user is allowed to edit.</p>
    <p><b>Visibility type</b></p>
    <p>Another factor restricting user rights is the <i>Visibility type</i> of a database object,
      which can be set in the Main tab of the <xref href="ui_passporteditor.dita">Passport
        Editor</xref>. The visibility options are: Public, Reader, Group, Project, and All
      Authenticated. Depending on the visibility type of a database object, it may only be available
      for viewing or editing to the users with the necessary rights. </p>
    <p/>
    <p>Default visibility type is "public", unless another setting has been made in
      "Preferences/Corpus Navigator Settings" (see chapter <xref href="ui_berlintextsystem.dita"
        >Preferences</xref>). The default visibility applies to all newly created database objects,
      which also includes annotations, rubra, comments etc. A change in the visibility status of a
      parent database object does not affect the status of any of its children. </p>
    <p>NOTE: If default visibility type of your  database items is "reader", you have to manually
      change all TC Objects, Texts, annotations, rubra etc. to "public" once you want to publish
      your text in the TLA.</p>
