        <li><b>Add "Active Corpora"</b><p>Choose the "Corpus Settings" option from the expanded menu
            and add the corpora you are going to be working with to the "Active Corpora" list. Press

        <li><b>Activate "Sort by sort key" option</b><p>Expand "Corpus Settings". Click "Corpus

                        Repeat the same for "Lemma Navigator Settings" and "Thesaurus Navigator
                        Settings" located in "Lemma List Settings" and "Thesaurus Settings"
                        respectively. </p><p>NOTE: By default all database objects have "0" as a
                        sort key and, as a result, are organized in alphabetical order on the same
                        level. </p></li>
        <li><b>Activate "Remember Me" option</b><p>By selecting the check box "Remember my login
            credentials on start-up" you can save your login credentials, so that BTS logs you in
            automatically each time the programm starts.</p></li>
        <li><b>Text Editor settings</b><p>Expand "Text Editor" and select "Sign Text Editor".
            Activating "Show Hieroglyphs", "Show Lemma ID", "Show Flexion" (=Inflection), and "Show
            Translation" is optional but is recommended. </p></li>
        <li><b>Applying the changes</b><p>Press "Apply" after each change to save it. Close the
            "Preferences" window by clicking "OK".</p></li>
