  <title>Entering Hieroglyphs</title>
  <body>
    <p>To enter or edit the hieroglyphs of your text, switch to the Sign Text Editor and then open
      the Hieroglyph Type Writer (HTW). HTW is based on a JSesh application created by Serge
      Rosmorduc. Make sure you have switched your keyboard back to normal, if you have just been
      entering transliteration.</p>

    <p>
      <ol id="ol_wj3_4yy_qt">
        <li>Click on a transliterated lemma in the Sign Text Editor tab, the word will be
          highlighted yellow. In the Hieroglyph Type Writer tab click into the "Type here" field -
          this is where the hieroglyphic input takes place. There are two different ways to enter
          the hieroglyphs. The first one is to enter the numbers of the Gardiner sign list (e.g.
          F18). The second is to enter the transliteration according to the Manuel de Codage rules.
          You can use both methods within a single word, as Manuel de Codage will automatically be
          rendered into Gardiner codes.</li>
        <li>When entering the first letters of the transliteration of a lemma, the programme will
          show you a list of hieroglyphs to choose from. Every hieroglyph has a number in red next
          to it; the first sign (1) is selected by default unless you choose otherwise by pressing
          CTRL and the number of your chosen sign. E.g. in the following screenshot there are four
          options shown for the input 'n', if you wanted to select the N35B-sign you would have to
          press CTRL+3.<p><image

              id="image_pnd_pfy_st"/></p>Afterwards, the corresponding Gardiner code will appear in
          the "type here" field and you will be able to continue inputting hieroglyphs normally. You
          could also type "N35B" directly into the "type here" field. <p><image

              id="image_vp5_qfy_st"/></p>Separate the hieroglyphs of a word either by a hyphen "-"
          between the hieroglyphs (meaning all the signs will be written one after another) or group
          them according to the "Manuel de Codage" rules with "-", "*", and ":". For more details
          see <xref href="howto_grouping.dita"/>. <p>NOTE: Grouping with "&amp;" is not
            allowed.</p><p>NOTE: Do not use the space bar to separate the signs because BTS will
            automatically replace spaces with a underscore (e.g. "M17 G53" will be rendered into
            "M17_-G43").</p></li>
        <li>In order to confirm the input of the signs and finish the work on one word, either press
          ENTER on your keyboard, or click the icon of the scribal tool in HTW (<image
            href="Images/icons/full/icon16/hieroglyphetw-ok.png" id="image_lvn_rxp_dx"/>). To move
          on to the next word, you can navigate using the following icons: ||&lt; and >|| will bring
          you to the first and last word of the document respectively, while |&lt; and >| will bring
          you to the word at the beginning and end of the line respectively (the line as it appears
          in the Sign Text Editor, not the line of the given text), while &lt; and > will bring you
          to the previous and next word respectively. A tool-tip will be displayed on mouse-over for
          each icon. You can also simply click on a word in the Text Editor to move on to it, if
          that word is not the next/last one in the document/line/sentence. </li>
        <li>After the input and confirmation of the signs, if you go back to that word, Gardiner
          numbers of the signs will be shown in the "type here" field, even if the signs were
          initially entered as "Manuel de Codage" transliteration. In order to see the sequence of
          numbers, select the already processed word.<p><image

              id="image_tdt_vfy_st"/></p></li>
        <li>If you need to correct an already confirmed word, you can return to it by clicking on it
          in the Sign-Text-Editor or by using the previously described navigation icons. Make the
          alterations in the "Type here" input field and confirm it by pressing ENTER or by clicking
          on <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/hieroglyphetw-ok.png" id="image_s5z_mvp_dx"/>. If
          you need to delete the already entered hieroglyphs, you can simply use the BACKSPACE or
          DELETE buttons on your keyboard and confirm by pressing ENTER. You can also click on the
            <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/hieroglyphetw-delete.png" id="image_ec2_4tg_wr"/>
          "Remove Hieroglyph Data" in the toolbar in the top right-hand corner.</li>
