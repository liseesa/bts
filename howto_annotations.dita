 <title>Annotations, Rubra, Glosses, and Comments</title>
 <conbody>
    <p>BTS text editing tools include annotations, rubra, glosses, and comments which can be applied
      to a word(s), phrase(s), or sentence(s). </p>
    <p>NOTE: This function does not apply to single letters within a word, e.g. if in the pronoun
        <i>jn</i> the <i>n</i> was omitted and later added in red: <i>j((n))</i>, this <i>n</i>
      cannot be individually annotated.</p>
    <p><b>What is the difference between an annotation, a gloss, a rubrum, or a comment?</b></p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_kk3_3lj_lx">
        <li><b>Annotation</b> provides the extra-textual information for parts of a text, which may
          include bibliographical references and other metadata. Annotations are not limited to one
          fragment, and can be connected to more than one section of a text. You can use
          annotations, for example, to divide your text into chapters (e.g. to define/separate the
          remedies of a medical text or the maximes of Ptahhotep) and other forms of alignment.
          Annotations can be used for syntactic, stylistic, and prosopographic information. As a
          result, there are different types and subtypes of annotations so that one can distinguish
          between these types of information. If you need further types and subtypes, please contact
          the BTS team in Berlin.<p>NOTE: Annotations can only be used to separate specific parts of
            a text if the sequence of these parts is clear. To mark sections of a text where the
            sequence of the chapters is not clear or ambiguous (e.g. a Ptolemaic temple scene with a
            main text and various smaller texts describing specific parts of the scene), then you
            should enter these texts separately as <b>Subtext</b>s.</p></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_f1y_jlj_lx">
        <li><b>Gloss</b> is a semantic or phonetic explanation of a passage in a text made by an
          ancient scribe (not a modern comment!), which can be written above the word or in the
          margin.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_kdd_klj_lx">
        <li><b>Rubrum</b> is used to mark rubrum in the text.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_k1s_klj_lx">
        <li><b>Comment</b> is additional information on a text which can discuss problems with
          translating a phrase or a word (unlike annotations, comments cannot have metadata such as
          e.g. bibliographical information). <p>The distinction between Annotations and Comments may
            seem arbitrary but is in place to allow a variety in the visibility and save locations
            of such additions. It also means that you can annotate database objects in a corpus in
            which you are a guest, without altering the original database object for other
            users.</p></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p><b>Annotating a text</b></p>
    <p>To annotate a text, use the icons menu above the "Text Editor" tab. Highlight the sequence
      you want to annotate with your mouse: for a single word just place the cursor within the word;
      if the word only contains a single character, place the cursor directly behind that character.
      A single token can have multiple annotations, and one annotation can refer to multiple
      different tokens. </p>
    <p>NOTE: If the buttons are deactivated, click somewhere outside of your text and then back into
      it.</p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_vgj_mlj_lx">
        <li><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/annotation-add.png" id="image_ixh_g4s_mr"/>
          <b>Add Annotation</b>: Adds an <xref href="howto_annotations.dita">Annotation</xref> to
          the selected part of your text. A grey bar appears in the "Annotation" tab to the right,
          with a thin line marking which part of the text the annotation refers to. You can then
          enter Passport Data for this annotation (i.e. extra-textual information). </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_q24_mlj_lx">
        <li><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/rubrum-add.png" id="image_gwm_dqs_mr"/>
          <b>Add Rubrum</b>: Converts the selected part of the text into a rubrum, which is
          indicated by a red font colour in the text and a red bar on the right. </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_qfs_mlj_lx">
        <li><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/subtext-add.png" id="image_zxr_pqs_mr"/>
          <b>Add Glosses</b>: Clicking on this button will add a "child"-element to your text in the
          corpora tree. The gloss can be edited like a regular text and can have passport data etc.
          Once created, it is labelled "BTS Text" until you rename it.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_vvv_mlj_lx">
        <li><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/comment-add.png" id="image_d5g_krs_mr"/>
          <b>Add Comment</b>: Adds a comment to the selected part of the text. This will be
          underlined in yellow.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>You can also access these functions via the drop-down menu that appears when you click on the
      triangle to the right of the annotation symbols.</p>
    <p>The existing annotations are displayed in the <xref href="ui_annotations.dita">Annotation
        tab</xref> on the right. New annotations appear at the bottom of this list. Use the arrow on
      the right of each annotation to expand it and see more information about it as well as further
      editing options. </p>
    <p>NOTE: All annotations on the transliterated tokens (including lemmatization) are anchored to
      the first and the last element of the token or the series of tokens. This means if you make
      changes to the first and the last element of the token(s), the annotations loose their link.
      If you need to make changes to an already lemmatized and/or annotated token, switch to the
      Sign Text Editor and make the changes in the field "Selected Word" (see also <xref
        href="howto_lemmatizing.dita"/>).</p>
    <p><b>Using transliteration signs in comments</b></p>
    <p>You can use transliteration signs in comments. This might be necessary, for example, if you
      want to discuss a particular word(s) in a sentence. In this case, write the transliteration
      between two "$" signs, so that the system knows to transform that text into cursive in the
      TLA, e.g.: $s·∏èm$.</p>
    <p><b>Deleting annotations</b></p>
    <p>You can delete an annotation by selecting it and clicking <image
        href="Images/icons/full/obj16/delete.png" id="image_b2z_jy4_sr"/> "Delete" in the upper
      right corner of the Annotation tab. A confirmation window will appear, click "Delete" to
      confirm or "Cancel" if you have changed your mind.</p>
    <p>NOTE: You cannot delete any annotation via the "Undo" button.</p>
    <p><b>Editing annotations</b></p>
    <p>Once you have created an annotation, rubrum, gloss, or comment you can edit it by selecting
      it in the Annotation tab: </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_gvl_xjj_lx">
        <li>Click <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/edit.png" id="image_jjk_l5t_mr"/> to edit
          the content and the metadata of the annotation.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul id="ul_nsk_kkj_lx">
        <li>Use <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/chain-add.png" id="image_ult_dv3_sr"/> to add
          another part of the text to the annotation. One annotation can refer to multiple parts of
          a text.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul id="ul_dvm_kkj_lx">
        <li>Use <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/chain-delete.png" id="image_zjx_hv3_sr"/> to
          remove a current reference. This only removes the link between the annotation and the part
          of the text; it does not delete the annotation.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
   <p><b>Using filters</b></p>
    <p>You can use filters to hide or display specific types or subtypes of annotations, e.g. you
      can hide all rubra from the list or display only comments. Select the filter by clicking
        <image href="Images/icons/extra%20icons/options_dreieck.png" id="image_bqy_twx_gx"/> in the
      Annotation tab. </p>
    <p>NOTE: When your text is loaded, BTS loads all annotations and filters them according to your
      filter settings, displaying the first 40 annotations. Annotations that are not displayed will
      appear in the list as soon as you click on the relevant annotated token in the Transliteration
      Editor.</p>
