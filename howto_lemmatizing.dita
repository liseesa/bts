 <title>Lemmatizing</title>
 <conbody>
    <p>Lemmatization is one of the most important steps in the BTS text editing process and is used
      in almost all queries and analyses done in the database, e.g. if you want to find references
      for a specific lemma, make collocation analyses, or search for word combinations etc. It is
      therefore essential that you lemmatize your text correctly.</p>
    <p><b>Opening and activating the lemmatizer</b></p>
    <p>To lemmatize a transliterated text you need two tabs open: <xref
        href="ui_texteditor_e10.dita">Sign Text Editor</xref> (default location: top centre) and
        <xref href="ui_lemmatizer.dita">Lemmatizer</xref> (default location: bottom centre; note
      that the title of this tab changes as soon as you select a database object in the Navigator
      tab). Only non-grey tokens in the "Sign Text Editor" are lemmata and can be lemmatized. </p>
    <p><image href="Images/STE.png" id="image_erk_k3s_2x"/></p>
    <p/>
    <p>Several elements are displayed in the <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/lemmatizer.png"
        id="image_dhr_pqv_nr"/> "Lemmatizer" tab:</p>
    <p><image href="Images/new%20screenshots/BTS%20Screenshots/Lemmatizer_marked.png"
        id="image_iht_myx_st"/></p>
    <p>
      <ol id="ol_xdz_4xy_qt">
        <li>"Activate" button: activates/deactivates the Lemmatizer (grey = deactivated; blue =
            activated).<p>NOTE: You should always deactivate the Lemmatizer after you have finished
            the lemmatization to avoid unintentional lemmatizations.</p></li>
        <li>"Selected Word" displays the transliteration of the lemma selected in the "Sign Text
          Editor". In the example above, <i>wbn</i> has already been lemmatized so the other fields
          are filled out. If you find out that you have made an error in the transliteration, you
          should modify it in the "Selected Word" field; the change will be updated in the
          Sign-Text-Editor and the Transliteration tab automatically. Note that the lemmatizer will
          search for lemma according to your transliterated token, ignoring any text after a full
          stop ".", which means you may have to manually search for tokens that contain this
          character (e.g. ḥm.t-nṯr).<p>NOTE: If you make changes to an already lemmatized token in
            the text editor, the token might loose its lemmatization, especially if you add a
            character to the beginning or the end of the word.</p></li>
        <li>The Lemma field shows the results of the system's search based on your transliterated
          token; it shows the lemma number (WCN) from the word list (WL) and the transliteration of
          the lemma which has been selected in the below list. To lemmatize a token, select the
          appropriate suggestion from the list below. The default setting in
          Preferences/Preferences/Lemmatizer allows you to activate the function "automatically
          select the first lemma proposal". This feature enables you to navigate through the
          proposals via the arrow keys on your keyboard.</li>
        <li>In the field "Flexion" you can record the grammatical form of this word by entering the
          appropriate code (see <xref href="grammar_inflection.dita"/>).</li>
        <li>In the field "Translation" you can choose one or several translations from the lower
          field; to choose several left-click and hold CTRL at the same time. If none of the options
          seem suitable, you can enter your own translation instead. Make sure you have selected the
          right language in the drop-down menu on the right; the only choices currently available
          are German and English. </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p><b>Organization of the lemma list</b></p>
    <p>The Lemmatizer provides a list of lemmas based on the parameters of your search (i.e. your
      transliteration). The entries are sorted alphabetically according to their Egyptological
      transliteration. Sublemmata are displayed as child-entries of their related (parent) lemmata.
      Each entry includes the transliteration, translation, word class, and bibliographical
      references of that lemma. The list is divided into two parts: at the beginning it displays the
      entries in which your search term occurs in the first position; entries in which your search
      term occurs in another position (e.g. composita) are shown in the latter part of the list.</p>
    <p>NOTE: The list of results is limited to 500 items. If you cannot find your lemma in the list,
      specify or alter your search parameters; you can use the TLA to find the word's lemma ID,
      which you can type in the section below. </p>
    <p>There are two kinds of icons in the list:</p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_cbf_syf_fx">
        <li><image href="Images/Icons_updated/full/icon16/lemma_checked.png" id="image_mhb_jmm_fx"/>
          This lemma has been revised and can be used for lemmatization.</li>
        <li><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/lemma-uncertain.png" id="image_ckk_1zf_fx"/> This
          lemma has not been revised yet. This applies in particular to personal names from Ranke's
          "Personennamen". If you would like to use this lemma, please contact the BTS team in
          Berlin (aegypt1@bbaw.de).</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p><b>Finding the correct lemma</b></p>
    <p>The lemmatizer automatically suggests lemmata whose transliteration exactly matches your
      lemma. If your lemma is not listed, click the magnifying glass <image
        href="Images/icons/full/icon16/search.png" id="image_zyn_pqp_nt"/> and search for it in the
      lemma list by entering the WCN (i.e. the ID), the transliteration, or the translation of the
      lemma. You can also filter the search results by using "Search for IDs" or "Search for Names
      only". Additionally, you can add wild cards / quotation marks by clicking the provided buttons
      in the search pop-up. For more details on the search function see <xref
        href="howto_searching.dita"/>. </p>
    <p><i>Search for ID (WCN number)</i></p>
    <p>To filter for a specific WCN you have to activate the check-box "Search for ID", as the
      (default) "Full text search" does not search for IDs. (This does not apply to the lemmata
      imported from the previous BTS version, which have the WCN set an external ID and which will
      thus show up in a "Full text search result").   </p>
    <p><i>Search for transliteration</i></p>
    <p>If you use the filter "Search for Names only", BTS does not execute a full text search, but
      only a search in the names of the database objects. This does not mean names as in "Personal
      Names", but is the standard description for what a database object is called when created,
      i.e. in this case it means the transliteration of the lemma (dictionary form). This box is
      activated by default, because otherwise BTS will make a full text search in the lemma list
      which would yield too many results. </p>
    <p><b>Confirming the selected lemma</b></p>
    <p>When you have found the correct lemma in the list, select it by left-clicking on it. Now
      select the specific translation for your text and click on <image
        href="Images/icons/full/icon16/lemma-ok.png" id="image_ktj_cqf_fx"/> "Confirm current lemma
      editing and continue to next unlemmatized word". The program will automatically move to the
      next unlemmatized word.</p>
    <p>NOTE: Due to technical reasons the confirmation button (<image
        href="Images/icons/full/icon16/lemma-ok.png" id="image_i5c_52x_dx"/>) does not always work.
      If this happens just press it a second time. Sometimes clicking this button <image
        href="Images/icons/full/icon16/lemma-ok.png" id="image_fsj_4qf_fx"/> moves the program to
      the first unlemmatized word in the text, rather than to the next unlemmatized word.</p>
    <p><b>Skipping lemmatization and navigating in the Sign Text Editor</b></p>
    <p>If you do not want to lemmatize a word, e.g. because the lemma does not exist in the list or
      you are not yet sure about its identification, you can skip the lemmatization by either
      clicking on the next word in the Sign Text Editor or by using the ">" button ("move selection
      to next word"). You can also use these buttons to navigate through the text without
      lemmatizing. The button ">" brings you to the next word, ">|" to the end of the line, and >||
      to the end of the text; the buttons "&lt;", "|&lt;" and "||&lt;" work vice versa.</p>
    <p><b>Encoding inflection</b></p>
    <p>We recommend lemmatizing a text and then adding codes in the field "Flexion". If you decide
      to encode the inflection during the lemmatization process, type the appropriate code into the
      field "Flexion" either before or after you have selected the lemma, and then confirm with
        <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/lemma-ok.png" id="image_zt4_fvf_fx"/>. For details see
        <xref href="howto_encoding.dita"/>.</p>
    <p><b>Remove all lemma information</b></p>
    <p>If you want to undo the lemmatization of a word, select the word and click on the button
        <image href="Images/Icons_updated/full/icon16/lemmatizer-delete.png" id="image_l33_m2g_ms"/>
      "Remove lemma information" in the Lemmatizer toolbar. This will remove both the lemmatization
      and the encoded inflection.</p>
    <p><b>Lemma does not exist</b></p>
    <p>In addition to the "Wörterbuch der ägyptischen Sprache", the BTS lemma list contains words
      from other sources. If you have a new lemma, which is not yet present in the BTS lemma list,
      please contact the BTS team in Berlin: aegypt1@bbaw.de. </p>
    <p>Before you send your proposal, please make sure that the lemma does not exist:</p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_vyl_yks_2x">
        <li>The transliteration of the lemma in the BTS might be different from your own (e.g.
          differentiation of s and z, weak consonants etc.).</li>
        <li>Beware of punctuation and structural signs.</li>
        <li>The word might be part of a composite-word.</li>
        <li>Your word might correspond to an already existing lemma with a different meaning.</li>
        <li>Your word list might not be indexed properly.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
