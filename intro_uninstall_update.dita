    <li><u>Update BTS</u><p>BTS automatically checks for updates every time you start the program.
            In case an update is found, you can choose to install it or postpone it. The update can
            be installed via the program's user interface as well, by clicking "Help / Update
            Application" in the top menu bar.</p></li>
    <li><u>Uninstall BTS</u><p>BTS is not listed in the "Control Panel/Programs/Programs and
      Features" section of your operating system, and so it cannot be uninstalled in the regular
      way. To uninstall the program, close the BTS program window and delete all files from the
      installation folder. </p><p>NOTE: You might have to restart your system before deleting the
      folder because the DB services might be still running in the background after closing the
      program, blocking the deletion. </p><p>NOTE: Using "Help/Uninstall software" entry in the
      upper menu bar of BTS will not uninstall the program completely, it will only uninstall
      individual components. You will might have to close the program window and delete again the
      files, which were blocked by running DB services. </p></li>
