    <p>Guests can read data but are not allowed to create new database objects or edit them. Guests
      will not be able to see the database objects with a visibility status set to <i>Reader</i>,
        <i>Group</i>, or <i>Project</i> if no status ( Reader/Updater) has been assigned to them. </p>
    <p>However, guests can view the content of a particular corpus, even if no user status has been
      provided. Similarly, guests can view the Lemma list and the Thesaurus database, but not modify
      them.  </p>
