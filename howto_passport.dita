  <title>Editing passport data </title>
  <body>
    <p>The Passport Editor is located in the bottom centre of the Text Corpus view. It is essential
      that you enter the metadata of your TCObjects, Texts, Subtexts, and Glosses correctly, since
      only complete and accurate metadata will allow effective search queries and statistical
      evaluation of the data.</p>
    <p>Most entries in the passport data are controlled by thesaurus lists, containing dates,
      locations, provenances, etc. These "controlled vocabulary" lists also include such entries as
      "unbekannt" ("not known") or "unbestimmt" ("not defined"). You can always discuss questionable
      facts, e.g. the findspot of an ancient Egyptian object or the date of a text, in the Comment
      fields.</p>
    <p>The thesauri are not complete yet. If a Thesaurus entry you need is missing, please send a
      proposal to the BTS team in Berlin: aegypt1@bbaw.de.</p>
