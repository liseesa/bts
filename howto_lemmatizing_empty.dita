  <title>Lemmatizing empty cartouches</title>
  <body>
    <p>Empty cartouches, e.g. in Ptolemaic and Roman texts, are transliterated with 3 underscores:
      "___" and are lemmatized with lemma ID (WCN) 550225.</p>
    <p>NOTE: Do not use this for damage or erased cartouches, e.g. an erased cartouche of Akhenaten;
      these should be entered as destruction, indicated by two hyphens <b>--...--</b>. E.g.: --rest
      of line destroyed--, --3Q-- (destruction of 3 scriptorial squares).</p>
    <p>Blank parts of a text that were intended for the later addition of a personal name and titles
      (e.g. on a coffin), are noted as descriptive information between two "#", see <xref
        href="howto_transliteration.dita"/>.</p>
